# tensorflow-for-fashion-MNIST-classification


I have created, trained and tested a simple neural network in tensorflow to classify images in the fashion MNIST dataset into one of the 10 clothing categories.

There are three layers in this neural net. A Flatten layer, which flattens the 28 by 28 input matrix into a vector
The second layer performs Relu and the output layer uses softmax to arrive at class probabilities.

I have saved this as a jupyter notebook, which can be easily opened in Google Colab.

You can easily open any notebook saved on Github using Google Colab. All you need to do is to put in the correct URL. for example:

github URL:  https://github.com/marjansherafati/tensorflow-for-fashion-MNIST-classification/master/notebook.ipynb

Colab URL to open the above file:  https://colab.research.google.com/github/marjansherafati/tensorflow-for-fashion-MNIST-classification/master/notebook.ipynb

#  Cheers!
